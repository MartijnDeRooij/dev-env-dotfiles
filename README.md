Dotfiles

This will be the initial setup for my personal development environment.
In here I will provide configuration files for bash, nvim, tmux  etc.

There are multiple reasons for doing this for me. 
1. I want the same experience regardless on which system I am on for devloping code or other things. 
2. I want to skill issue myself to stay motivated as this means I have things to learn but more importantly I find out what I don't know so I know what I don't know and are able to learn it. 
3. Once setup I no longer have to think about what different IDEs do. It will work my way and I have set it up my way.
4. Its fun actually the real and only reason 

# Setup Notes
There are three different possible environments (MAC, Windows (please stop breaking), Linux. 
In my case I will focuss for now on Ubuntu (debian linux) distro and Windows. Because so far there are the only two I have ever used.

I have used many resources for this from the officials docs of NVIM to many creators like ThePrimeagen and TJdevries.

# PC Setup basic things to install first such as GIT otherwise this repo cannot be used. 

## Ubuntu (debian linux)

```bash
DOTFILES_DIR=$HOME/Repos/github.com/MartijnDeRooij
mkdir -p $DOTFILES_DIR
cd $DOTFILES_DIR
git clone https://github.com/MartijnDeRooij/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
```



Starup setup nvim:
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install openssh-server
sudo systemctl enable ssh
echo "alias vim="nvim"" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "alias vi="nvim"" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "PROMPT_COMMAND='history -a'" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "PROMPT_COMMAND='history -a'" >> ~/.bash_profile
sudo snap install nvim --classic
sudo apt install git
sudo apt install curl
sudo apt install -y xclip
sudo apt install ripgrep
sudo apt install fd-find
sudo git clone https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim.git "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}"/nvim
sudo apt install build-essential
sudo nvim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
	X11forwarding yes
sudo nvim ~/.ssh/config 
HOST *
	ForwardX11 yes
nvim
	:checkhealth

## Windows (WSL setup)
[Windows Docs for Linux on Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)

* Install WSL in powershell (Also because from personal experience it is here the easiest to run bash scripts for the automated setup)


* Use [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install) to install Windows Terminal Preview using `choco install microsoft-windows-terminal --pre`
* Get gruvbox-material color scheme for Windows Terminal. 
* Open the settings.json in windows preview by opening a new tab and click on Settings while holding shift
* Paste in the colorschemes and asssign it to the Ubuntu profile in Windows Terminal

There is an issue with npm on wsl ubuntu 22. Use this to install npm: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73673804/npm-show-npm-elf-not-found-error-in-wsl

# Neovim Setup

**Important**: This is my latest config with lazy.nvim

_If you clone the repo into your machine and use the config by copying .config/nvim to your home folder, wait for the plugins, language servers and parsers to install with lazy.nvim, Mason and nvim-treesitter. If you are opening a lua file or another file I have language servers configured for, like html, css or javascript/typescript, you might also get an error saying that the server failed to start. This is because Mason hasn't installed it yet. Press enter to continue, Mason will automatically install it._

# Terminal Setup

‚úçüèº Blog Post Step-by-Step Guide: [How To Setup Your Mac Terminal](https://josean.com/posts/terminal-setup)


- True Color Terminal Like: [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/)
- [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) (Version 0.9 or Later)
- [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) - I use Meslo Nerd Font
- [Ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) - For Telescope Fuzzy Finder
- XCode Command Line Tools
- If working with typescript/javascript and the typescript language server like me. You might need to install node.

If you're on mac, like me, you can install iTerm2, Neovim, Ripgrep and Node with homebrew.

```bash
brew install --cask iterm2
```

```bash
brew install neovim
```

```bash
brew install ripgrep
```

```bash
brew install node
```

For XCode Command Line Tools do:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

Platform-specific requirements are listed below.

### Ubuntu / Debian

```sh
sudo apt-get install ninja-build gettext cmake unzip curl g++
```

### Windows 

TODO

#### Built steps
0. Go to x directory
1. `git clone https://github.com/neovim/neovim`
2. `cd neovim && make CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo`
- If you want the **stable release**, also run `git checkout stable`.
